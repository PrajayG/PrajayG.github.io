# My Personal Site

This is my [personal site](https://www.thediscursive.com), it is a statically generated website using Jekyll, which means it loads incredibly quickly. I've used netlify to handle updating the site too, so no direct git commits are required to create a new post. You just need to login through the netlify gateway. Another big plus for this set up is that because Github is handling the hosting, the upkeep of the entire website is only the cost of the domain name.
