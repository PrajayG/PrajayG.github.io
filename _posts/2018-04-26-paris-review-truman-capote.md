I've been reading a collection of Paris Review interviews recently. These are great deep dives into various writer's lives and their writing process. I finished Truman Capote's brilliant 'In Cold Blood' a couple of months back and found this quote quite illuminating as to why I found it such an engrossing, powerful read.

Call it precious and go to hell, but I believe a story can be wrecked by a faulty rhythm in a sentence— especially if it occurs toward the end—or a mistake in paragraphing, even punctuation. Henry James is the maestro of the semicolon. Hemingway is a first-rate paragrapher. From the point of view of ear, Virginia Woolf never wrote a bad sentence. I don’t mean to imply that I successfully practice what I preach. I try, that’s all._

Despite the shocking content, In Cold Blood remains a fluid read that sucks you in and doesn't let go. It's sometimes easy to forget that doing this in literature is a hugely difficult task, sometimes it's nice to get reminders like this - great books are hard work.
