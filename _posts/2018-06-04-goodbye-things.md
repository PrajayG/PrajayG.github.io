It's not hard to think of 'minimalist living' as a meme. It conjures up images of perfectly white apartments with a solitary Mac perched on a refurbished wooden desk, with a cup of coffee on it (obviously you should be able to spot the steam leaving). Personally I think it is no surprise this movement has caught an entirely new audience, and a much wider reach just as the image based Instagram slowing starts to become 'the' dominant social networking app. 

Despite all this needless pessimism, I picked up 'Goodbye, things' because I was curious, and maybe a small part of me wanted to get rid of my giant mountain of unused garbage in my room, but mostly it was innocent curiosity. Fumio Sasaki's book is a half manual half mantra - a tale of self realisation through grand simplification in the same vein as the other big book in this space - Mari Kondo's 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying'. 

The book gives you a ton of useful advice when it comes to throwing away stuff, and a large section of the book is dedicated to the potential benefits you stand to receive. Most of it is pretty obvious - 'if you haven't used it for a year - chuck it!'. Where it shines are the little nuggets of advice you might have missed - because you haven't spent the last 5 years thinking about minimalism. 

> We are social animals that act in packs; we can't thrive without proving your existence has value. We need others to recognize our qualities so we can believe that our life is worth living. To show this value, we communicate our qualities through our belongings. But when we become too reliant on that method, we end up being surrounded by too many possessions. The objects that are supposed to represent our qualities become our qualities.

Everyone knows about that whole 'buying things to impress others' idea, but personally, I'd never really thought about the idea of possessions as qualities, and not simply tools to get across our own, deeply personal qualities. Interesting!

Goodbye, things has a haphazard quality to it, where it sort of falls apart trying to explain itself, or Sasaki finds himself praising 'Apple's minimalism' for the 10th time, which boils down to 'Well my Smartphone and Laptop can do many things, wasn't Steve Jobs amazing?'. This is a fun read that isn't especially taxing, or serious, there are some nice platitudes and some interesting ideas that definitely encourage further reading. Mostly, I see 'Goodbye, things' as the story of one man removing all the distractions from his life and finally writing that book he'd always wanted to, and taken for that - it's pretty compelling.
