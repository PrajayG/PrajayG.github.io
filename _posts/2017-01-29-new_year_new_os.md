I recently took the plunge and installed Linux on a whim. I recently got a preowned Thinkpad X1 Carbon, I think it's a third generation. It has a super high res screen and is built like a tank, with a hinge that goes ALL THE WAY back. Like the new MacBook pro is has a screen for Function buttons, these change between two main layouts and it's hilariously unusable. With no drag functionaility it sits their awkwardly, I avoid it and it mostly stays out of my way. I don't see this impasse ending anytime soon. Installing Linux, in my case I went with the idiot-proof Ubuntu was a breeze, I used the standard USB installation from the main website. One thing that me, as an idiot, forgot was that I had would have to format the USB as a bootable drive, once I did this it was good to go. Instead of trying out Ubuntu for a short period of time, or dual booting, I decided to completely wipe my machine, with no hard data on there this seemed fine. Right?

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a gorgeous high resolution display, the first time I used it after my old Macbook Air was a revelation, it's impossible not to notice, unless of course you are Ubuntu. On booting for the first time, the scale was completely screwed which meant everything was tiny, which is great if you want to fit in 16 terminals to one window, but not particularly useful if you want to read any text. I scaled everything up using the inbuilt settings and went along my way, installing sublime and chrome, as well as all my dev command line tools. It turns out that Chrome doesn't play nice when it comes to scaling and upon opening it, you are presented with a HUGE UI, bookmarks take up half the screen and the whole thing looks awful. Fortunately with the help of Gnome Tweak Tool and some digging in Chrome's config file I was able to sort this out. 

I installed Ubuntu a very long time ago on my parents laptop as a way to get some extra life out of a dying machine, and I was shocked to see, on booting it now that it pretty much looks the same. This had to change. One trip to reddit.com/r/unixporn later and I found out that heavy customization is not for me. Instead I installed the Paper Theme with Paper Icons and I was good to go.

I’m a couple of weeks into using Ubuntu and so far I haven’t had any hiccups, installing from the command line isn’t the stress I’d thought it be, it’s just like having pip install actual programs. Most of my apps work fine, and having a proper terminal is great for any sort of dev work. I’ve even start to making the slow but steady transition to VIM. I had started to use VIM quite a bit for editing on remote servers at work, seeing as it is available pretty much everywhere so made sense to get decent at it. ‘:vimtutor’ and sensible.vim are a good start. Sensible.vim also introduces you to pathogen, an easy way to install new vim plugins. 

The main takeaway from all this isn’t that Ubuntu is a user friendly, easy to setup OS, which it totally is by the way. But its that the entire process, when it came to files and programs I use heavily was almost seamless. So much of my personal data now exists on the cloud. Of course, that’s not always a good thing but it does mean that getting a new PC is no longer burdened by huge set up times. I use google docs, most of my music exists on spotify now. I have a desktop, but that only really contains high res photos and my ever aging mp3 collection. Everything else seems to be pretty transient. Apart from heavy duty photo/video editing programs and games, linux has most bases covered. Config files for programs like Sublime can be switched easily too. 

For dev work, writing and browsing I'm finding Ubuntu perfectly capable, it's even handled the touchscreen and bastard-son-fake-function-row on this thing absolutely fine. I'm not a Linux convert now, and to be honest picking an OS side has never interested me, but I'm enjoying Ubuntu, and installing it has told me a ton about my own computer habits and what I actually find important in a personal machine - it turns out, Ubuntu has all of that.
