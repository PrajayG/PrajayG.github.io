title: "Turning a Kindle Fire 7 into an android e-reader"
---

The Kindle Fire 7 is not a particularly impressive device. Buying one straight from the source means you’re pretty much stuck in the claws of the mighty Amazon buy stream. If you go for the cheap option, you get a lockscreen displaying garish full screen ads, and once you unlock you’re given a ton of options for watching, reading and listening to Amazon content. The smallest member of the Fire family often goes on sale here in the uk for £30 and despite all the bloatware and the dire screen, it’s still very much worth picking up - here’s why.
The Kindle Fire makes a great tablet for textbooks and light reading. Sure, it doesn’t have the easy on the eyes e-ink display of its more admired namesake but it can display PDFs - in full colour! Of course to use it this way, as a dedicated reading device you’ll want to make a few fundamental changes to how the device runs. First, the Google Play Store has to be installed. The Amazon App store is a sad place, devoid of the vibrant third party app ecosystem that both iOS and Android devices normally enjoy. Getting the play store is an easy task, just downloading some apks, and editing some system settings. Here is a good [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRP1ZoKwrjM). Once this is done you can start downloading your own apps. I use Moon reader Pro for ebooks and documents and it works great, I store my books in Google Drive, and download them onto the device from there. 

Next, you’ll want to remove home screen that Amazon thinks you’ll enjoy using, it’s a mess and looks horrible. To do this download Nova Launcher, I had to download a separeate app called [Launcher Hijack](https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/themes-apps/app-root-launcherhijack-custom-launcher-t3409531). Once this is downloaded you simply open it and select Nova. Now, every time you press home you’ll be shown your Nova Configured Home Screen instead.

For basic reading, with the WiFi turned off, the battery lasts an age. If you have an ebook collection, or have collected various pdfs over the years, you won’t find a cheaper way to read them on the go.
