      Turning a Kindle Fire 7 into a custom reading
    </a>
  </h1>
  <div class="post-date">Feb 25, 2018</div>
  <p>The Kindle Fire 7 is not a particularly impressive device. Buying one straight from the source means you’re pretty much stuck in the claws of the mighty Amazon buy stream. If you go for the cheap option, you get a lockscreen displaying garish full screen ads, and once you unlock you’re given a ton of options for watching, reading and listening to Amazon content. The smallest member of the Fire family often goes on sale here in the uk for £30 and despite all the bloatware and the dire screen, it’s still very much worth picking up - here’s why.
The Kindle Fire makes a great tablet for textbooks and light reading. Sure, it doesn’t have the easy on the eyes e-ink display of its more admired namesake but it can display PDFs - in full colour! Of course to use it this way, as a dedicated reading device you’ll want to make a few fundamental changes to how the device runs. First, the Google Play Store has to be installed. The Amazon App store is a sad place, devoid of the vibrant third party app ecosystem that both iOS and Android devices normally enjoy. Getting the play store is an easy task, just downloading some apks, and editing some system settings. Here is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRP1ZoKwrjM">tutorial</a>. Once this is done you can start downloading your own apps. I use Moon reader Pro for ebooks and documents and it works great, I store my books in Google Drive, and download them onto the device from there.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll want to remove home screen that Amazon thinks you’ll enjoy using, it’s a mess and looks horrible. To do this download Nova Launcher, I had to download a separeate app called <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire/themes-apps/app-root-launcherhijack-custom-launcher-t3409531">Launcher Hijack</a>. Once this is downloaded you simply open it and select Nova. Now, every time you press home you’ll be shown your Nova Configured Home Screen instead.</p>

<p>For basic reading, with the WiFi turned off, the battery lasts an age. If you have an ebook collection, or have collected various pdfs over the years, you won’t find a cheaper way to read them on the go.</p>

      New Year New OS

  <p>I recently took the plunge and installed Linux on my main machine. I recently got a preowned Thinkpad X1 Carbon third generation. It has a super high res screen and is built like a tank. Like the new MacBook pro it has a screen instead of function buttons, these change between two main layouts and are basically unusable. With no drag functionality it just sits there awkwardly, I avoid it and it mostly stays out of my way. I don’t see this impasse ending anytime soon.</p>

<p>Installing Linux, in my case I went with the idiot-proof Ubuntu was a breeze, I used the standard USB installation from the main website. One thing that me, as an idiot, forgot was that I had would have to format the USB as a bootable drive, once I did this it was good to go. Instead of trying out Ubuntu for a short period of time, or dual booting, I decided to completely wipe my machine, with no hard data on there this seemed fine. Right?</p>

<p>The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a gorgeous high resolution display, the first time I used it after my old Macbook Air was a revelation, it’s impossible not to notice, unless of course you are Ubuntu. On booting for the first time, the scale was completely screwed which meant everything was tiny, which is great if you want to fit in 16 terminals to one window, but not particularly useful if you want to read any text. I scaled everything up using the inbuilt settings and went along my way, installing sublime and chrome, as well as all my dev command line tools. It turns out that Chrome doesn’t play nice when it comes to scaling and upon opening it, you are presented with a HUGE UI, bookmarks take up half the screen and the whole thing looks awful. Fortunately with the help of Gnome Tweak Tool and some digging in Chrome’s config file I was able to sort this out.
I installed Ubuntu a very long time ago on my parents laptop as a way to get some extra life out of a dying machine, and I was shocked to see, on booting it now that it pretty much looks the same. This had to change. One trip to reddit.com/r/unixporn later and I found out that heavy customization is not for me. Instead I installed the Paper Theme with Paper Icons and I was good to go.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/desktop.png" alt="Desktop" /></p>

<p>I’m a couple of weeks into using Ubuntu and so far I haven’t had any hiccups, installing from the command line isn’t the stress I’d thought it be, it’s just like having pip install actual programs. Most of my apps work fine, and having a proper terminal is great for any sort of dev work. I’ve even started to making the slow but steady transition to VIM. I had started to use VIM quite a bit for editing on remote servers at work, seeing as it is available pretty much everywhere so made sense to get decent at it. ‘:vimtutor’ and sensible.vim are a good start. Sensible.vim also introduces you to pathogen, an easy way to install new vim plugins.</p>

<p>The main takeaway from all this isn’t that Ubuntu is a user friendly, easy to setup OS, which it totally is by the way. But it’s the entire process, when it came to files and programs I use heavily was almost seamless. So much of my personal data now exists on the cloud. Of course, that’s not always a good thing but it does mean that getting a new PC is no longer burdened by huge set up times. I use google docs, most of my music exists on spotify now (which certainly has its own problems). I have a desktop, but that only really contains high res photos and my ever aging mp3 collection. Everything else seems to be pretty transient. Apart from heavy duty photo/video editing programs and games, linux has most bases covered. Config files for programs like Sublime can be switched easily too.</p>

<p>For dev work, writing and browsing I’m finding Ubuntu perfectly capable, it’s even handled the touchscreen and bastard-son-fake-function-row on this thing absolutely fine. I’m not a Linux convert now, and to be honest picking an OS side has never interested me, but I’m enjoying Ubuntu, and installing it has told me a ton about my own computer habits and what I actually find important in a personal machine - it turns out, Ubuntu has all of that.</p>
